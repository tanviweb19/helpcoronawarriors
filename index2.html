        <h1>INSIGHT OF PLASMA THERAPY</h1>
                                      
        <p> 
            <h2>WHAT IS PLASMA?</h2><br>
            Plasma is the yellow liquid portion of blood comprised of water, salts, and proteins which contains numerous proteins essential for proper functioning of the body.Insufficient levels of any one plasma protein prevents the body from carrying out vital functions, causing a variety of chronic and life-threatening medical conditions.<br><br>
            <h2>WHAT IS COVID-19 PLASMA AND HOW DOES IT HELP?</h2><br>
            COVID-19 plasma is plasma collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. The blood of people who have recovered from an infection contains antibodies. Antibodies are molecules that have learned to recognize and fight the pathogens, such as viruses, that have caused disease.<br><br>
            
            Convalescent plasma therapy may be helpful for people with COVID-19 who aren't helped by other treatments. Some people with COVID-19 become very sick and don't respond to other treatments or drugs. They often require mechanical assistance, such as a ventilator, to breathe. These people also are in danger of developing organ failure.<br><br>
            
            <h2>THE PROCEDURE</h2><br>
            Before donated blood can be used, it must be tested for safety. It then goes through a process to separate out blood cells so that all that's left is plasma with antibodies.<br><br>
            
            A special machine separates the plasma and often the platelets from the donorsâ€™ blood sample. This process is called plasmapheresis. The remaining red blood cells and other blood components are then returned to the body.<br><br>
            
            The plasma is then carried to the patient.<br><br>
            
            <h2>WHO CAN DONATE COVID-19 PLASMA?</h2><br><br>
            In addition to meeting the donor eligibility criteria, donors must have had a prior infection of COVID-19 and must have recovered from symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation. In addition they should:<br><br>
            <ul>
             <li>Have had symptoms like breathing problem, cough, cold, fever, body ache.</li>
            <li>The stronger the symptoms, the stronger the antibodies</li>
            <li>Not have had any children (women only).</li>
            <li>Not have diabetes.</li>
            <li>Not have high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Not be over the age of 65.</li><br><br>
